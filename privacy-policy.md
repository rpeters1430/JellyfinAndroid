**Effective Date:** January 27, 2026
**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how Jellyfin Ryan ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our Android application. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Overview

Jellyfin Ryan is an unofficial third-party client for Jellyfin media servers. The App operates as a bridge between your device and your personal Jellyfin server. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

**Key Privacy Principles:**
- We do **not** collect, store, or have access to your personal information
- We do **not** collect, store, or have access to your Jellyfin server credentials
- We do **not** sell or share your data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes
- We collect only anonymous diagnostic data to improve app stability and performance

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information We Do NOT Collect

The App does **not** collect:
- Personal identification information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)
- Jellyfin server URLs or addresses
- Authentication tokens or login credentials
- User IDs or account information
- Media viewing history or preferences
- Payment information
- Location data
- Contact lists or other device data

### 2.2 Automatically Collected Anonymous Data

To maintain and improve the App's performance, we collect limited anonymous technical data through Google Firebase services:

**Crash Reports (via Firebase Crashlytics):**
- Stack traces and error logs when the app crashes
- Device model and manufacturer
- Android OS version
- App version code and name
- Timestamp of the crash
- Device state at time of crash (memory usage, orientation, etc.)

**Performance Metrics (via Firebase Performance Monitoring):**
- App startup time
- Screen rendering performance
- Network request latency
- HTTP response codes
- App foreground/background duration

**Anonymous Usage Analytics (via Firebase Analytics):**
- Screen views and navigation patterns
- Feature usage frequency
- Session duration
- Device characteristics (screen size, language, timezone)
- App installation and update events

**Important:** All data collected is anonymous and cannot be used to personally identify individual users. Firebase automatically assigns a random identifier to your app installation, which is not linked to your identity.

### 2.3 Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The following information is stored **only on your device** and is **never transmitted to us**:

- Jellyfin server connection details (URLs, ports)
- Authentication tokens and session credentials (encrypted using Android Keystore)
- User preferences and app settings
- Downloaded media files (if offline mode is used)
- Playback position and watch history (synced with your Jellyfin server only)

This data remains on your device until you clear app data, uninstall the App, or manually delete it.

## 3. How We Use Information

Anonymous data collected through Firebase is used exclusively to:

- **Diagnose and fix crashes** to improve app stability
- **Monitor performance issues** to optimize speed and responsiveness
- **Understand feature usage** to prioritize development efforts
- **Ensure device compatibility** across different Android versions and device models
- **Track app installation trends** to understand user growth (anonymous only)

We do **not** use collected data to:
- Track individual users across apps or services
- Build user profiles or behavioral patterns
- Serve advertisements or marketing content
- Sell or rent data to third parties

## 4. How We Share Information

### 4.1 Third-Party Service Providers

The App uses the following third-party services that may collect and process anonymous data:

**Google Firebase (Crashlytics, Performance Monitoring, Analytics)**
- **Purpose:** Crash reporting, performance diagnostics, anonymous usage analytics
- **Data Collected:** As described in Section 2.2
- **Privacy Policy:** [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

**Jellyfin Server (User-Operated)**
- **Purpose:** Media streaming and playback
- **Data Shared:** Authentication tokens, playback requests, media metadata requests
- **Important:** Your Jellyfin server is operated by you or a third party you trust. We do not operate, control, or have access to any Jellyfin servers. All communication with your server is direct between your device and the server. Please review your server administrator's privacy policy.

### 4.2 Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., court orders, government agencies), including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. However, given that we do not collect personally identifiable information, such disclosures would be limited to anonymous diagnostic data.

### 4.3 Business Transfers

In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, anonymous usage data may be transferred to the acquiring entity. You will be notified via this Privacy Policy of any such change.

## 5. Data Security

We take data security seriously and implement industry-standard measures to protect information:

### 5.1 Local Data Protection
- **Android Keystore Encryption:** All server credentials and authentication tokens are encrypted using the Android Keystore system, providing hardware-backed encryption on supported devices
- **Secure Storage:** Sensitive data is stored in encrypted shared preferences
- **Certificate Pinning:** Dynamic Trust-on-First-Use (TOFU) model protects server communications from man-in-the-middle attacks
- **HTTPS Only:** All network communications use encrypted HTTPS connections

### 5.2 Anonymous Data Protection
- Firebase data is transmitted over encrypted connections (TLS/SSL)
- Data is stored securely on Google's infrastructure with industry-standard security measures
- Access to Firebase data is restricted to authorized developers only

### 5.3 Your Responsibilities
- Keep your device secure with lock screen protection
- Only connect to Jellyfin servers you trust
- Do not share your Jellyfin server credentials with untrusted parties
- Keep the App updated to receive security patches

**Note:** While we implement strong security measures, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Data Retention

### 6.1 Anonymous Diagnostic Data
- **Crash Reports:** Retained for up to 90 days by Firebase Crashlytics
- **Performance Metrics:** Retained for up to 90 days by Firebase Performance Monitoring

## 8. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction).

We do **not** knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The anonymous diagnostic data we collect through Firebase does not include age information and cannot be used to identify children.

## 9. International Data Transfers

The anonymous data collected through Firebase may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States, where Google operates data centers.

These countries may have data protection laws different from those in your jurisdiction. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of anonymous information to these countries. Google Firebase complies with applicable data protection frameworks, including:
- EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for GDPR compliance

Your Jellyfin server communication is direct and does not pass through our systems. The location of data processing depends on where your Jellyfin server is hosted.

## 10. Third-Party Links and Services

The App may contain links to third-party websites, services, or content (e.g., links within your Jellyfin media library, external movie databases).

**Important:** We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services. This Privacy Policy applies only to the App. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you access.

Specifically:
- **Jellyfin Server:** Operated independently; review your server administrator's privacy policy
- **External Links:** May be present in media descriptions; we do not control these destinations
- **Third-Party SDKs:** Firebase is the only third-party SDK; see Section 4.1
