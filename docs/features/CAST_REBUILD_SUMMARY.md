# Chromecast Rebuild - Quick Reference

## 📋 What We Created

This planning phase produced comprehensive documentation for rebuilding the Chromecast system:

### 1. **CHROMECAST_REBUILD_PLAN.md** (50+ pages)
Comprehensive technical plan with:
- Current state analysis with known issues
- Complete architecture design with diagrams
- 6 implementation phases with 24 detailed tasks
- Effort estimates and acceptance criteria
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and post-implementation roadmap

### 2. **docs/CAST_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md**
Ready-to-use GitHub issue template with:
- Executive summary of rebuild effort
- Phase breakdown with task list
- Timeline and success metrics
- Getting started guide

## 🎯 Quick Start

### To Create the GitHub Issue:
1. Go to: https://github.com/rpeters1430/JellyfinAndroid/issues/new
2. Copy content from `docs/CAST_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`
3. Set title: "🎯 Rebuild Chromecast System from Scratch"
4. Add labels: `enhancement`, `chromecast`, `architecture`

### To Start Implementation:
1. Read [CHROMECAST_REBUILD_PLAN.md](../CHROMECAST_REBUILD_PLAN.md) thoroughly
2. Start with **Phase 1: Foundation** (must be done in order)
3. Follow each task's acceptance criteria
4. Create separate PRs for each phase
5. Write tests as you go (TDD recommended)

## 📊 Key Stats

- **Total Tasks**: 24 major tasks across 6 phases
- **Timeline**: 16-23 days solo, 2-3 weeks with team
- **Effort**: 120-160 hours estimated
- **Coverage Goal**: 80%+ domain layer, 70%+ UI layer
- **Success Metrics**: Defined for functional, performance, and code quality

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

New system separates concerns into clear layers:

```
UI Layer → ViewModel → Domain Layer → Data Layer
                          ↓
            (Session, Playback, Discovery, Queue)
                          ↓
              (StateRepo, PrefsRepo, CastAdapter)
```

## 📝 Current Issues Being Fixed

**Architecture**:
- Complex state management
- Mixed concerns in one class
- Threading issues
- Hard to test

**Functional**:
- Unreliable session recovery
- State sync issues
- Subtitle loading problems
- Poor error handling
- Position tracking inconsistencies

**UX**:
- No device discovery UI
- Generic error messages
- No connection feedback
- Can't disconnect from UI
- No queue management

## ✅ What's Next

After reading the plan and creating the GitHub issue:

1. **Phase 1.1**: Start with domain models (2-3 hours)
   - Create `CastDevice`, `CastSessionState`, `CastPlaybackState`, `CastError`
   - Framework-agnostic, immutable data classes
   
2. **Phase 1.2**: Create `CastStateRepository` (4-6 hours)
   - StateFlow-based reactive state
   - Thread-safe state management
   
3. **Continue** through phases in order...

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Read First**: Don't skip the full plan - it has critical details
2. **Follow Order**: Phases build on each other
3. **Test Everything**: Write tests as you code, not after
4. **Small PRs**: One phase per PR for easier review
5. **Ask Questions**: Comment on the GitHub issue if unclear
6. **Track Progress**: Update the issue checklist regularly

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

All planning is complete. The ball is now in the implementation court. Good luck! 🚀
