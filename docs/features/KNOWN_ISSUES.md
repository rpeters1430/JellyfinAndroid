## 🔴 CRITICAL Issues (App-Breaking)

**Status**: None currently identified

---

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY Issues (Significant Impact)

### #10: Casting Requires Unauthenticated or Proxy URLs

**Impact**: Cast playback may fail on servers that require tokenized URLs
**Affected Users**: Users casting from secured Jellyfin servers
**Files**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/ui/player/CastManager.kt`

**Details**:
- Cast receivers do not support custom authorization headers
- Access tokens are no longer appended to Cast URLs
- Requires either a trusted local proxy or an unauthenticated streaming endpoint for casting

**Workaround**:
- Use a local proxy that injects authorization headers
- Allow unauthenticated access to the specific streaming endpoint (if acceptable)

**Fix Status**: ✅ Documented trade-off (Phase B1)

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY Issues (Functionality Gaps)

### #5: Authentication Interceptor Blocks OkHttp Threads

**Impact**: Slow token refresh, potential network timeouts
**Affected Users**: All users during token refresh (every 24 hours)
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/network/JellyfinAuthInterceptor.kt:159`

**Details**:
- Token refresh uses `runBlocking` in OkHttp interceptor
- Backoff strategy uses `Thread.sleep()` which blocks OkHttp threads
- Can cause network requests to queue up during refresh
- May cause timeout errors if refresh takes too long

**Workaround**:
- None for users - token refresh is automatic
- If experiencing network timeouts, restart app to force new session

**Fix Status**: 🔜 Planned
**Canonical Plan**: [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN §Phase C](../plans/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md#phase-c-reliability--error-handling-high)
**Target**: Phase 3 - Code Quality

**Code Location**:
```kotlin
// JellyfinAuthInterceptor.kt:159 - Blocking backoff
private fun backoff(attempt: Int) {
    Thread.sleep(calculateBackoff(attempt)) // Blocks OkHttp thread
}
```

**Files**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/data/offline/OfflineDownloadManager.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/ui/downloads/DownloadsScreen.kt`

**Details**:
- Offline downloads are implemented and generally functional
- Remaining risk is reliability under prolonged background constraints and intermittent connectivity
- Validation focus is WorkManager constraints, retry behavior, and resume handling after process death

**Workaround**:
- Keep app unrestricted by battery optimization when downloading large libraries
- Prefer stable Wi-Fi for large jobs

**Fix Status**: 🔜 Planned
**Canonical Plan**: [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN §Phase C](../plans/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md#phase-c-reliability--error-handling-high)

## ✅ Recently Resolved Issues

### Auto-Play Next Episode (✅ Fixed Jan 23, 2026)
**Status**: Implemented with countdown UI and automatic continuation
**Commit**: `8463e8bd` - "feat: implement auto-play next episode feature with countdown and UI updates"

### Auto Quality Selection (✅ Fixed Jan 2026)
**Status**: "Auto" now clears track overrides to enable ExoPlayer adaptive selection when multiple video tracks are available
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/ui/player/VideoPlayerViewModel.kt:1026-1068`
**Details**: Selecting Auto clears video track overrides and keeps `selectedQuality` null to reflect adaptive playback

### Offline Download Hanging (✅ Fixed Jan 2026)
**Status**: Fixed by replacing `collect` with `first()` and adding timeout
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/data/offline/OfflineDownloadManager.kt:207`
**Details**: `getDecryptedUrl()` was collecting infinite DataStore Flow - now uses `first()` to read single value

### Download ID Mismatch (✅ Fixed Jan 2026)
**Status**: Fixed by making `startDownload()` suspend and returning actual ID
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/data/offline/OfflineDownloadManager.kt:84-94`
**Details**: Placeholder UUID was returned to callers - now returns real download ID

### Cache Directory Initialization Race Condition (✅ Fixed Jan 2026)
**Status**: Fixed with `ensureCacheDir()` function and proper initialization
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/data/cache/JellyfinCache.kt`
**Details**: 
- Added `ensureCacheDir()` function that safely initializes cache directory on demand
- `cacheItems()` now calls `ensureCacheDir()` before disk access (line 126)
- `getCachedItems()` now calls `ensureCacheDir()` before disk access (line 168)
- Prevents NullPointerException crash on first app launch or after cache clear

### Memory Cache Thread Safety (✅ Fixed Jan 2026)
**Status**: Fixed with synchronized blocks around memory cache access
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/data/cache/JellyfinCache.kt`
**Details**:
- Memory cache operations now wrapped in `synchronized(memoryCache)` blocks
- Read operations (lines 149-165) protected from concurrent modification
- Write operations (lines 120-123, 174-181) protected from race conditions
- Prevents ConcurrentModificationException and data corruption

### GlobalScope Replacement in JellyfinCache (✅ Fixed Jan 2026)
**Status**: Replaced GlobalScope with ApplicationScope
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/data/cache/JellyfinCache.kt:30, 82`
**Details**:
- Constructor now injects `@ApplicationScope` CoroutineScope via Hilt
- Init block uses applicationScope instead of GlobalScope (line 82)
- Properly bound to application lifecycle, no more memory leaks
- Cache cleanup operations can be properly cancelled

## 📘 Common Connection Issues & Troubleshooting

### DNS Resolution Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Error message: "Could not find an IP address for the server hostname"
- Error message: "Could not resolve server hostname"
- Connection fails when using a hostname (e.g., `jellyfin.myserver.com`)

**Root Causes**:
- `android.system.GaiException: EAI_NODATA` - Hostname exists but has no DNS records
- `android.system.GaiException: EAI_NONAME` - Hostname does not exist
- DNS server misconfiguration or connectivity issues
- Typo in server hostname
- Expired or missing DNS records

**Troubleshooting Steps**:

1. **Verify hostname spelling**: Double-check the server address for typos, extra spaces, or incorrect characters.

2. **Try using an IP address directly**:
   - IPv4 example: `http://192.168.1.100:8096`
   - IPv6 example: `http://[fe80::1]:8096`
   - If connecting via IP works, the issue is DNS-related.

3. **Check DNS configuration**:
   - Test DNS resolution on another device (computer, phone)
   - Use `nslookup` or `dig` to verify DNS records exist
   - Verify your device's DNS settings in network configuration

4. **Network-specific solutions**:
   - **Local network**: Use IP address instead of hostname
   - **Remote access**: Ensure DNS records are properly configured with your domain registrar
   - **Reverse proxy**: Verify reverse proxy DNS points to correct server

5. **Alternative connection methods**:
   - Use Jellyfin Quick Connect if DNS is unreliable
   - Configure a static IP on your Jellyfin server
   - Use a Dynamic DNS service (e.g., DuckDNS, No-IP) for remote access

**For Server Administrators**:
- Verify DNS A/AAAA records exist for your hostname
- Check DNS propagation (may take up to 48 hours)
- Ensure internal DNS (if used) has correct entries
- Test external DNS resolution from multiple providers
- Consider using a more reliable DNS provider
