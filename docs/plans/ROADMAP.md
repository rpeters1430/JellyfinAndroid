> **Quick Links**: [Feature Status](CURRENT_STATUS.md) | [Known Issues](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) | [Upgrade Path](UPGRADE_PATH.md)

A clear, actionable improvement plan for the Jellyfin Android client.

---

## Current Status

### Working Features
- Server connection & authentication (multi-server, auto-login)
- Secure credential storage (Android Keystore, AES-256-GCM encryption)
- Certificate pinning (TOFU model)
- Video playback (ExoPlayer/Media3, HLS/DASH, FFmpeg decoder, adaptive track selection)
- Library browsing (Movies, TV Shows, Music)
- Material 3 Expressive UI with dark/light/AMOLED themes
- Resume playback, favorites, search
- Android TV UI (partial)

### Partially Working
- **Music playback** - UI exists, background playback incomplete
- **Offline downloads** - Screen exists, core functionality incomplete
- **Android TV** - Screens exist, D-pad navigation needs testing

### Verified Complete
- **Picture-in-Picture** - Full implementation with remote actions (play/pause, skip ±30s)
- **Chromecast** - Full casting with seek bar, volume control, position tracking
- **Auto-Play Next Episode** - Automatic continuation with countdown UI (added Jan 23, 2026)
- **Progress Sync Resilience** - Local queuing and background sync for offline playback (added Feb 5, 2026)
- **Transcoding position reset fix** - Position preserved across codec flushes with retry limits
- **Transcoding diagnostics tool** - Identifies which videos need transcoding and why

### Needs Improvement
- **Transcoding system** - Works but missing DeviceProfile, hardcoded bitrates, broken network assessment. See [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN Phase A](docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md#phase-a-transcoding--playback-system-overhaul-critical)
- **Subtitle system** - Embedded subs work, but no external subs, no ASS/SSA styling, no sync delay

### Not Implemented
- Live TV & DVR
- Sync Play (watch together)
- Home screen widgets
- Multi-profile support

## Phase 1.5: Transcoding & Playback System Overhaul

> **Full Details**: [docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md - Phase A](docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md#phase-a-transcoding--playback-system-overhaul-critical)

The transcoding system works for basic playback but has architectural gaps that cause unnecessary transcoding and degrade quality. This phase addresses the critical server communication and decision-making issues.

### 1.5.1 DeviceProfile & Server Communication
**Priority**: Critical | **Effort**: 5-7 days

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement Jellyfin DeviceProfile specification (send device capabilities to server)
- [ ] Fix broken network quality assessment (currently hardcoded to HIGH)
- [ ] Send AudioStreamIndex/SubtitleStreamIndex to server for multilingual content
- [ ] Implement transcoding session lifecycle (heartbeat, cleanup)

Files: `data/DeviceCapabilities.kt`, `data/repository/JellyfinStreamRepository.kt`, `data/playback/EnhancedPlaybackManager.kt`

### 1.5.2 Quality Control & Adaptivity
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 3-5 days

Tasks:
- [ ] Make bitrate thresholds configurable (WiFi/Cellular/LAN separate)
- [ ] Add default playback quality user preference
- [ ] Add adaptive bitrate during playback (detect buffering, auto-reduce quality)
- [ ] Unify codec detection logic (3 separate implementations → 1 source of truth)

Files: `data/playback/EnhancedPlaybackManager.kt`, `ui/player/VideoPlayerViewModel.kt`, `data/DeviceCapabilities.kt`

### 1.5.3 Error Recovery Improvements
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: 2-3 days

Tasks:
- [ ] Replace string-matching fallback detection with ExoPlayer error codes
- [ ] Distinguish codec errors vs bitrate errors vs resolution errors
- [ ] Allow multiple fallback attempts (currently limited to 1)
- [ ] Try lower quality before switching to full transcoding

Files: `ui/player/VideoPlayerViewModel.kt`

---

## Phase 1.6: Subtitle & Preference Improvements

### 1.6.1 Subtitle System
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: 3-5 days

Tasks:
- [ ] Enable external subtitle support (currently filtered out)
- [ ] Preserve ASS/SSA styling instead of converting everything to VTT
- [ ] Add subtitle sync delay setting (±5 seconds)
- [ ] Add subtitle encoding preference

Files: `ui/player/VideoPlayerViewModel.kt`

### 1.6.2 Playback Preferences
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: 3-5 days

Tasks:
- [ ] Add preferred audio language setting (currently hardcoded to English)
- [ ] Add auto-play next episode toggle with configurable countdown
- [ ] Add auto-skip intro/outro preference
- [ ] Add resume playback mode (Always/Ask/Never)

Files: `ui/player/VideoPlayerViewModel.kt`, new DataStore preferences

---

## Phase 2: Android TV Polish

### 2.1 D-pad Navigation Audit
**Priority**: High for TV | **Effort**: 3-5 days

Tasks:
- [ ] Test all TV screens with D-pad only (no touch)

- [ ] Verify initial focus placement on each screen
- [ ] Test with multiple remote types

Screens to audit:
- [ ] `TvHomeScreen.kt`

- [ ] `TvItemDetailScreen.kt`
- [ ] `TvVideoPlayerScreen.kt`

### 2.2 TV Player Controls
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: 2-3 days

Tasks:
- [ ] Test seek with D-pad
- [ ] Test play/pause with select button
- [ ] Add back button handling
