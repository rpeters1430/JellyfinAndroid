## Phase 1.5: Transcoding & Playback System Overhaul — COMPLETED ✅

> **Full Details**: [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md - Phase A](IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md#phase-a-transcoding--playback-system-overhaul-completed-)

The transcoding system works for basic playback but has architectural gaps that cause unnecessary transcoding and degrade quality. This phase addresses the critical server communication and decision-making issues.

### 1.5.1 DeviceProfile & Server Communication
**Priority**: Critical | **Effort**: 5-7 days

Tasks:
- [x] Implement Jellyfin DeviceProfile specification (send device capabilities to server)
- [x] Fix broken network quality assessment (currently hardcoded to HIGH)
- [x] Send AudioStreamIndex/SubtitleStreamIndex to server for multilingual content
- [x] Implement transcoding session lifecycle (heartbeat, cleanup)

Files: `data/DeviceCapabilities.kt`, `data/repository/JellyfinStreamRepository.kt`, `data/playback/EnhancedPlaybackManager.kt`

### 1.5.2 Quality Control & Adaptivity
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 3-5 days

Tasks:
- [x] Make bitrate thresholds configurable (WiFi/Cellular/LAN separate)
- [x] Add default playback quality user preference
- [x] Add adaptive bitrate during playback (detect buffering, auto-reduce quality)
- [x] Unify codec detection logic (3 separate implementations → 1 source of truth)

Files: `data/playback/EnhancedPlaybackManager.kt`, `ui/player/VideoPlayerViewModel.kt`, `data/DeviceCapabilities.kt`

### 1.5.3 Error Recovery Improvements
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: 2-3 days

Tasks:
- [x] Replace string-matching fallback detection with ExoPlayer error codes
- [x] Distinguish codec errors vs bitrate errors vs resolution errors
- [x] Allow multiple fallback attempts (currently limited to 1)
- [x] Try lower quality before switching to full transcoding

Files: `ui/player/VideoPlayerViewModel.kt`

- [ ] Add subtitle encoding preference

Files: `ui/player/VideoPlayerViewModel.kt`

### 1.6.2 Playback Preferences
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: 3-5 days

Tasks:
- [ ] Add preferred audio language setting (currently hardcoded to English)
- [ ] Add auto-play next episode toggle with configurable countdown
- [ ] Add auto-skip intro/outro preference
- [ ] Add resume playback mode (Always/Ask/Never)

Files: `ui/player/VideoPlayerViewModel.kt`, new DataStore preferences
