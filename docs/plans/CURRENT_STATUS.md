## Known Limitations

### Material 3 Components
- **Carousel**: Using official Material 3 carousel API (HorizontalUncontainedCarousel) wrapped by `ExpressiveHeroCarousel`
- **Alpha Dependencies**: Intentionally using Material 3 alpha versions for Expressive components
- **Migration Path**: Will update when Material 3 Expressive reaches stable (see [UPGRADE_PATH.md](UPGRADE_PATH.md))

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Composables**: Some screens are large (HomeScreen: 1,119 lines, VideoPlayerScreen: 1,726 lines) - planned refactor in [ROADMAP §3.1](ROADMAP.md#31-refactor-large-files)
- **Image Loading**: Optimized with device performance profiles (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/FLAGSHIP tiers)
- **Memory**: LeakCanary enabled in debug builds for leak detection

### Platform Limitations
- **Min SDK 26**: No support for Android 7.x and below
- **Java 21 Required**: Uses core library desugaring for compatibility
- **No Wear OS**: Not supported (no plans)
- **No Android Auto**: Not supported (no plans)
