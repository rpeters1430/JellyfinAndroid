## 🔴 CRITICAL Issues (App-Breaking)

**Status**: None currently identified

---

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY Issues (Significant Impact)

### #1: Cache Directory Initialization Race Condition

**Impact**: Potential crash on first launch or after cache clear
**Affected Users**: All users (low probability, high severity if triggered)
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/data/cache/JellyfinCache.kt:63-93`

**Details**:
- Cache directory initialization happens asynchronously via `GlobalScope`
- `cacheItems()` and `getCachedItems()` methods use `cacheDir` directly without ensuring initialization
- If cache operations are called before `ensureCacheDir()` completes, app will crash with `NullPointerException`
- Race condition is most likely on first app launch or after clearing app data

**Workaround**:
- None for users - issue is timing-dependent
- Developers: Add `ensureCacheDir()` call before disk access in `cacheItems`/`getCachedItems`

**Fix Status**: 🔜 Planned - [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN Priority 3](docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)
**Target**: Phase 1 - Core Stability

**Code Location**:
```kotlin
// JellyfinCache.kt:63 - Async initialization
init {
    GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
        ensureCacheDir()
    }
}

// JellyfinCache.kt:100-144 - Uses cacheDir without ensuring init
private suspend fun cacheItems(...) {
    // Directly uses cacheDir - can crash if not initialized
}
```

---

### #2: Memory Cache Thread Safety

**Impact**: Potential data corruption in cached library items
**Affected Users**: All users during concurrent cache operations
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/data/cache/JellyfinCache.kt:119-125, 166`

**Details**:
- Memory cache (`memoryCache`) is a mutable `HashMap` without synchronization
- Disk cache hit path updates `memoryCache` without synchronization (line 166)
- Memory cache read path (`getCachedItems`) checks `memoryCache` without synchronization (line 119-125)
- Concurrent reads/writes from multiple threads can cause `ConcurrentModificationException` or silent data corruption

**Workaround**:
- None for users - issue is non-deterministic
- Developers: Use `synchronizedMap()` wrapper or replace with thread-safe cache (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`)

**Fix Status**: 🔜 Planned - [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN Priority 4](docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)
**Target**: Phase 1 - Core Stability

**Code Location**:
```kotlin
// JellyfinCache.kt:166 - Unsynchronized write
memoryCache[cacheKey] = items // Not thread-safe

// JellyfinCache.kt:119-125 - Unsynchronized read
memoryCache[cacheKey]?.let { cached ->
    return@withContext cached // Race condition
}
```

### #3: GlobalScope Usage Causes Memory Leaks

**Impact**: Background operations continue after app closure, potential memory leaks
**Affected Users**: All users (increased battery drain, memory pressure)
**Files**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/data/cache/JellyfinCache.kt:75`
- `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/utils/ImageLoadingOptimizer.kt:28`

**Details**:
- `GlobalScope` is used for cache cleanup and image loader initialization
- `GlobalScope` coroutines are not bound to any lifecycle - they outlive the app
- Cache cleanup can continue running after app is closed
- Image loader operations cannot be properly cancelled
- Increases memory pressure and battery usage

**Workaround**:
- None for users
- Developers: Replace `GlobalScope` with Hilt-provided `ApplicationScope`

**Fix Status**: 🔜 Planned - [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN Priority 5](docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)
**Target**: Phase 1 - Core Stability

**Code Location**:
```kotlin
// JellyfinCache.kt:75 - GlobalScope usage
GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
    cleanupExpiredCache() // Outlives app lifecycle
}

// ImageLoadingOptimizer.kt:28 - GlobalScope usage
GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
    // Image loader init - cannot be cancelled
}
```

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY Issues (Functionality Gaps)

### #4: Auto Quality Selection Not Implemented

**Impact**: Users must manually select video quality
**Affected Users**: All users during video playback
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/ui/player/VideoPlayerScreen.kt:1311`

**Details**:
- Quality menu shows "Auto" option but it's not functional
- Clicking "Auto" does nothing (TODO comment in code)
- Users must manually switch quality based on network conditions
- No adaptive bitrate streaming based on bandwidth

**Workaround**:
- Manually select quality from video player menu
- Use lower quality on slow networks to avoid buffering
- Use higher quality on fast WiFi for best experience

**Fix Status**: 🔜 Planned - [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN Priority 6](docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)
**Target**: Phase 2 - Performance & UX

**Code Location**:
```kotlin
// VideoPlayerScreen.kt:1311 - TODO comment
Text("Auto") {
    // TODO: Implement auto quality selection
}
```

### #5: Authentication Interceptor Blocks OkHttp Threads

**Impact**: Slow token refresh, potential network timeouts
**Affected Users**: All users during token refresh (every 24 hours)
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/rpeters/jellyfin/network/JellyfinAuthInterceptor.kt:159`

**Details**:
- Token refresh uses `runBlocking` in OkHttp interceptor
- Backoff strategy uses `Thread.sleep()` which blocks OkHttp threads
- Can cause network requests to queue up during refresh
- May cause timeout errors if refresh takes too long

**Workaround**:
- None for users - token refresh is automatic
- If experiencing network timeouts, restart app to force new session

**Fix Status**: 🔜 Planned - [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN Priority 8](docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)
**Target**: Phase 3 - Code Quality

**Code Location**:
```kotlin
// JellyfinAuthInterceptor.kt:159 - Blocking backoff
private fun backoff(attempt: Int) {
    Thread.sleep(calculateBackoff(attempt)) // Blocks OkHttp thread
}
```
